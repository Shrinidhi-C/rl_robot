# Reinforcement Learning Robot
The goal of this project is to create a program which learns to control a robot through an environment with only limited information about the state of the robot's vicinity. In order to accomplish the goal, we utilize reinforcement learning. 

In this README, we provide a bit of background about our robot and an overview of the results we observed. 

## Reinforcement Learning
// TODO describe reinforcement learning

## The Robot
// TODO describe robot here

## Technology
* VREP - a is a versatile robotic simulation software. Components of a VREP simulation, e.g. joint, camera, etc., can be controlled (among other things) through a remote API via HTTP reqeuests.
* PyBrain - a Python library which provides a swath of machine learning algorithms. In particular, [PyBrain provides a framework for reinforcement learning](http://pybrain.org/docs/tutorial/reinforcement-learning.html) which we used to develop a program that learns how to control our robot. The program interfaces with VREP via VREP's remote API.
